##  Neural Network Animal Classifier

This project uses a neural network model trained to recognize and classify **10 different animal species** based on image data.  
The model learns from labeled examples and identifies animals by extracting key features through multiple training iterations.

## Animals Included
- Dog  
- Cat  
- Tiger  
- Elephant  
- Crocodile  
- Lion  
- Bear  
- Deer  
- Horse  
- Monkey  

This project serves as a simple and effective demonstration of image classification using machine learning. It can be expanded or adapted to larger datasets or more complex architectures.
